# PyBer_Analysis

***Overview ***

PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion
V. Isualize has given Me and  Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type for their project . Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we ’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
I am only be in my second week at PyBer, but there's one thing I 've learned along the way that you know applies here too: if I  fail to plan, I  plan to fail. That’s why I will do my very best for best for the project .

So before I  dive into these massive datasets, you sit down and scope out the analytical project to make sure me  and Omar are on the same page about the final deliverables.
It would be foolish to start messing around with such a large dataset without knowing exactly what you're trying to get out of it. So you and Omar have a head-to-head to clarify the process and outcomes for this project. You come up with the following list of steps and deliverables:
•	Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
•	Merge your DataFrames.
•	Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
•	Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
o	The total number of rides for each city type.
o	The average fares for each city type.
o	The total number of drivers for each city type.
•	Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
o	The number of rides for each city type.
o	The fares for each city type.
o	The number of drivers for each city type.
•	Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
o	The percent of total fares.
o	The percent of total rides.
o	The percent of total drivers.
Omar has agreed on my plan so here we come  the project scope. It's time to get to work!
that you have the summary statistics for the revenue by city type, you think it would be a good idea to get the summary statistics for the number of drivers by city type. After all, I  want to be well prepared to answer any question in your presentation. Having this data in hand will allow V. Isualize and other stakeholders to know which cities need more driver support.


***Results ***

were as below :

The Total Rides in 

Rural : 5%               total of            125 rides
Suburban : 27%     total of            625 rides
Urban : 68%           total of            1625 rides 

Total Drivers in Service :
Rural : 3%  -     total of                78 drivers
Suburban :  16%   total of           490  drivers 
Urban : 81%           total of            2405 drivers 



***Summary ***


I summarize and recommend the PYbar to make some incentives for drivers to work on rural and suburban given that both areas are participating only to 30% of the profit and the average of the fare is around 34 dollars the highest .
